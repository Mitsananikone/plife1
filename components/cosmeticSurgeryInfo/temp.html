          Cosmetic surgery breast enhancement (augmentation) is usually done to
          enhance the size or shape of breasts or to balance a difference in

          behind the breast tissue or above the breast muscle.{" "}
          <b>Breast Implants</b> come in a variety of shapes and sizes, with
          varying designs, in a range of materials. They can be placed in
          different <b>positions</b> through a variety of{" "}
          <b>incision locations</b>. The goal is to leave your breasts looking
          as natural as possible while enlarging them to your desired size.

          The surgeon may recomment that a <b>breast lift</b> and breast
          augmentation be performed at the same time. This is mostly commonly
          recommended to treat the sagging appearance that results from aging or
          pregnancy. DUring this combined procedure, some breast tissue is
          removed, the breast skin is tightened and lifted, and an implant is
          inserted.
